# Flutter Performance Optimization Configuration
# This file contains optimizations applied to improve app performance

# Build optimizations for release mode
release_optimizations:
  # Enable tree shaking
  tree_shaking: true
  
  # Minify code
  minify: true
  
  # Optimize assets
  compress_assets: true
  
  # Enable obfuscation for smaller APK
  obfuscation: true

# Asset optimization settings
asset_optimizations:
  # Image compression settings
  image_quality: 70
  max_image_width: 600
  max_image_height: 400
  
  # Enable caching
  enable_image_caching: true
  cache_size_limit: 100MB

# Performance tips applied:
applied_optimizations:
  - "Removed expensive BackdropFilter blur effects"
  - "Added image caching with cacheWidth and cacheHeight"
  - "Implemented lazy loading for navigation routes"
  - "Added Material 3 for better performance"
  - "Optimized page transitions"
  - "Added image preloading for critical assets"
  - "Reduced blur sigma values"
  - "Used const constructors where possible"

# Recommended next steps:
recommendations:
  - "Compress large images (>1MB) using the optimize_images.py script"
  - "Test app performance on different devices"
  - "Monitor memory usage during navigation"
  - "Consider using cached_network_image for remote images"
  - "Implement widget recycling for lists"
  - "Add performance profiling in debug mode"
